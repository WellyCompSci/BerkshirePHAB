                            <p>Berskshire Phab was founded by volunteers and it is thanks to everyone who has
                                volunteered over the years that we are still able to help so many people. There are lots
                                of ways that you can volunteer with us and they all make a difference.
                                If you've never volunteered before why not contact us at the centre.
                            </p>
                            <h3><b>Club Volunteers</b></h3>
                            <p>Berkshire Phab's clubs are run by our experienced staff with help from volunteers, and we
                                need lots of people to help keep the centre open every week. Volunteering with us can be
                                rewarding and inspiring. If you've never worked with disabled
                                people before don't be scared! Phab is the ideal environment to enjoy the company of
                                some of the most interesting and dynamic people you'll ever meet, and all the while you
                                will find the experience hugely rewarding. Volunteers can help
                                out on one or more days at our drop-in club for adults which takes place Monday to
                                Thursday, 10am to 4pm. We also need volunteers at our youth club which takes place on a
                                Saturday 9.30-1pm.
