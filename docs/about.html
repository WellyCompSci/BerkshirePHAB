                We, at Berksire Phab, are a charity whose main focus is to help both disabled and non-disabled people share experiences, meet new people, enjoy activities designed for all abilities, and, most importantly, create memories. We open our doors four days
                a week for a drop-in club dedicated to adults, and on Saturdays for children and young people in our youth club. We run occasional outings, and offer a delicious cooked lunch at our weekday club. Our activities include Berkshire Phab has
                been in the Reading area for over 40 years now and is based on a purpose-built community centre with full disabled access at 22 Mount Pleasant, off Silver Street, close to the centre of Reading. We are part of a nationwide network of clubs
                supported by Phab UK.

                As with all Phab clubs, our aim is to promote and encourage opportunities where both disabled and non-disabled people can share experiences on an equal basis, working towards both an inclusive and supportive society. To learn more about the other Phab
                clubs, visit the national website: <a href="https://www.phab.org.uk/">www.phab.org.uk</a></p>

                <br>"A big Thank you to you  and Margaret for all your kindness and support over the last few years. The group has really helped boost our sons self esteem and provided friendship at some of his lowest points. My husband has also enjoyed being able to  sneak into Reading for an expensive coffee and some retail therapy. Not to forget of course that we would never have got our sofa if you hadn't been looking after the boys for us."

                      All our trustees are volunteers and work tirelessly behind the scenes to ensure that we
